# Train-Scheduler_Moment.js-Firebase






## Purpose Of App:
This app provides several forms to input data of that which would resemble a departure screen at a train station. The app takes the information that jQuery links to within the DOM and places it in the Firebase database. Upon reload, a function within the app will loop through such data pieces and use them to calculate how many minutes away the next train is and at what time such train will arrive.

### Text Walk Through:

Simply fill out the forms for "Train Name," "Destination," "First Train Time," and "Frequency." Once this is finished, hit the submit button to run the function that pushes the form data to the database.
